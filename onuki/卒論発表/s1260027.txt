Abstract: Location-based systems have become an integral part of our daily lives. In recent years, many navigation applications using AR technology have been released, but most of these applications are mainly designed for outdoor use and track location using GPS. On the other hand, research for indoor applications is still in its infancy due to the limitations of GPS satellites. In this paper, we propose to use existing WiFi access points for indoor positioning using the kinematic method. In addition, we present an augmented reality navigation solution that guides the user to the destination by displaying the route. As a result of implementing and testing the system, we found that it was successfully developed, but the effect of the experimental environment on AR was found to include errors in positioning under certain conditions, which is also discussed.
